# Weather Forecasting with NeuralProphet

Description:
A weather forecasting model that uses NeuralProphet, an advanced time series forecasting library built on top of PyTorch. The model processes historical weather data and predicts future weather trends such as temperature, humidity, and rainfall.

Technologies: NeuralProphet, Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

Results: Achieved accurate weather predictions for up to a week in advance, with visualized forecast results using line graphs and time series plots.
